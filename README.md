# CriminalIntent
 
Second project from "Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide". 
Topic covered include:
* fragments
* master-detail interfaces 
* list-backed interfaces
* menus 
* the camera 
* implicit intents, and more.

CriminalIntent records the details of “office crimes” – things like leaving dirty dishes in the breakroom sink or walking away from an empty shared printer after documents have printed. (p. 123)
